<h1>Anja Schmidt's Portfolio</h1>

This is my personal portfolio website featuring all the web development projects I have realized.

<h2>Getting Started</h2>

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>

You need to have git set up on your local machine. If you are unfamiliar with the necessary steps, please find a step-by-step guide <a href="https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-First-Time-Git-Setup" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>

<h3>Setup</h3>

Once you have git set up on your computer, go to gitHub and open the dropdown menu by clicking on "code". Copy the project's HTTPS.

<h3>Install</h3>

In your terminal, navigate to where you want to set up the project folder, then enter git clone [project link], with the link being the one you just copied.

<h3>Usage</h3>

You can now edit the code or view it in your browser

<h3>Deployment</h3>

To open the project in your browser, find the project folder, right click on the html file and choose open in. Select the browser you would like to open the file with.
